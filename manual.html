      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>A committee member just require a phone or laptop with internet access.</p>
      <p>If you are using the security feature, the guards need a phone/computer with internet access.</p>
      <p>Every security post should have one mobile phone.</p>
      <p>The next step is to create some users.</p>
    <br>
      <h3>How to create Users</h3>
      <p>There are three main ways to create users:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Data Import</li>
        <li>Resident Sign Up</li>
        <li>Manual Creation</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To sign up, share the sign up link with residents:</p>
      <img src="images/screenshots/sign_up_requests/new.png" alt="Sign Up Page" class="image">
      <p>After filling out the form, the committee would then approve and create the user:</p>

      <h2>Types of Main Users</h2>
      <p>There are two types of main users on this platform:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Normal Users (Residents)</li>
        <li>Power Users (Committee Members)</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>How to create users?</h3>
      <p>There are two ways to create accounts for users/residents:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Manual Creation</li>
        <li>Data Import</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Creating Payments</h2>
      <h3>Who Can Create Payments?</h3>
      <p>Both Normal Users and Power Users can create payments.</p>

      <h3>Normal Users Creating Payments</h3>
      <p>When a Normal User creates a payment, it involves:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Entering their house address.</li>
        <li>Choosing the number of cars and providing each car’s plate number.</li>
        <li>Attaching a payment receipt and specifying the payment method, payment date, and any remarks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> When a Normal User creates a payment, it is tied only to that user who created it.</p>

      <h3>Power Users Creating Payments</h3>
      <p>A Power User can do everything a Normal User does, plus:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Change the house address for the payment.</li>
        <li>Change the user associated with the payment.</li>
        <li>Update car details on the payment.</li>
        <li>Confirm the payment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s recommended that Normal Users (residents) create and enter their own payment details to reduce the committee’s workload. However, Power Users (committee members) can also create payments on behalf of Normal Users and <strong>must</strong> confirm all payments.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Confirming Payments</h2>
      <p>When a payment is confirmed, it means the attached payment receipt matches the payment details. Once confirmed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An email with the payment receipt is automatically sent to the user’s email,
          <strong>as long as they have logged in at least once before</strong> (to ensure the email is valid).
        </li>
        <li>
          Both Normal Users and Power Users can view the confirmed receipt on the website.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> We only send receipts to users who have logged in before. This may change in the future, depending on the RA’s request, to allow sending to all users regardless of their login status.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Additional UX Features</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Auto-Fill From Previous Year</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When creating payment details for a house that had a payment in the previous year, the system can automatically:
              <ul>
                <li>Display users associated with that house (making it easier to select who the payment is for).</li>
                <li>Copy the number of cars and car plate numbers from last year to speed up the process.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Quick Confirmation (Beta)</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Lets Power Users quickly view the payment receipt and details on a single page for easy confirmation.</li>
            <li>Allows edits to the payment on the same page.</li>
            <li>Once a payment is confirmed, the system automatically takes you to the next payment in line for confirmation.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Normal Users</h2>
      <p>
        Certain features are only available to Normal Users who have “paid” for the latest year. A Normal User is considered
        to have paid for the latest year if they’re associated with a house that has a payment confirmed by a Power User.
      </p>

      <h3>Normal User Features</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Search Car Plates</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Users can look up car plate details, but the information shown is limited for privacy:
              <ul>
                <li>If the car is associated with a payment, it will show that the car belongs to a specific street (but not the house number).</li>
                <li>If the car is not associated with any payments, it will show the latest entry (date and time) of the car into the neighborhood and the street it visited (again, not the house number).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Registered Visitors</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Users can register visitors’ vehicles in advance.</li>
            <li>
              When the security guard enters the visitor’s car plate, they’ll see that this car is a registered visitor, which can reduce ID checks and speed up entry.
            </li>
            <li>This feature’s effectiveness depends on the RA security’s standard operating procedures.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>RSVP for Events</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Users can see what events are happening (e.g., AGM) and submit RSVPs, specifying the number of attendees.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
